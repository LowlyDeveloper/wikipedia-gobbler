# 📚 Wikipedia Gobbler

A Wikipedia search web app built with HTML, JavaScript, and the melting of my prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus, and all lobes.

It lets you:
- Search Wikipedia pages using a cute lil search bar
- See summaries + thumbnails
- Get a disambiguation page when you mess up spelling
- Click suggested results to search again instantly
- Experience Comic Sans as God intended
